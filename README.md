## About Project

App built by David Douglas

This is a full stack NextJS project using ReactJS under the hood for the front-end and Firebase for the back-end.

More details about development can be found on the app's [About](https://davids-party-room.vercel.app/aboutsection) page.

I built this project for fun and to challenge myself. I wanted to better my full-stack develpment skills and practice creating hollistic applications that implement smooth, responsive user interfaces and communicate with databases that are efficient and scalable. Working on this project was great practice for me to work on improving the user experience of an application from all angles, maximizing aesthetics, functinality, and speediness(load times) simultaneously.
